                        Richard Wright, born September 4, 1908, in the city of Natchez, Mississippi, was an African American writer of many popular and controversial
                        writings. He often wrote about the issues of society that he observed as a child and as an adult. The majority of these issues were directly
                        related to race relations primarily between whites and blacks during the 20th century.

                        Growing up in poverty and under a single mother made Wright's life very similar to the majority of young blacks at the time. Before the age of
                        21 Wright had worked several jobs, and was in and out of school. At the same time Wright was discovering his extreme thirst for knowledge, and
                        his strong desire to learn to read and write.

                    <p>Throughout his life, Wright wrote several books ranging from Drama, to Non-fiction, the most popular being the one that we will be analyzing,
                         titled <em>Black Boy</em>, which was written in 1945. Some of his other works include, <em>Native Son</em>, written in 1940,
                        <em>The Outsider</em>, written in 1953, <em>The Long Dream</em>, written in 1958, and <em>Lawd Today</em>, written in 1963. Along with a 
                        number of his other works, <em>Black Boy</em> was met with disdain, the most notable case
                        being from white supremacist Senator from Mississipi, stating

                        <span className="quote">"Its purpose is to plant the seeds of devilment and trouble-breeding in the days to come in the mind and heart of every American Negro.... It is the dirtiest, filthiest, lousiest, most obscene piece of writing that I have ever seen in print. I would hate to have a son or daughter of mine permitted to read it; it is so filthy and so dirty. But it comes from a Negro, and you cannot expect any better from a person of his type" (Tristam, Pierre)</span>

                        Along with this, the book was banned by the board of education of the Island Trees Union Free School District. This happened in 1982 and
                        resulted in a US Supreme Court Case in 1982, named Island Trees School Distric v. Pico (Island Trees Sch. Dist. v. Pico by Pico).

                    <p>Before taking a look at specific individuals that insipired the work of Richard Wright, it is important to note the importance of the rising 
                        communist party in the mid-20th century. After constantly moving from place to place, Wright ended up arriving in Chicago and made his way
                        into the American Communist Party. From here in 1938, Wright published <em>Uncle Tom's Children</em>. which was a collection of stories
                        depicting blacks revolting against their government and the environment around them. According to Wright, many of the books he wrote between
                        1932 and 1944 were reflections of his beliefs tied to communism. He believed that communism was the only set of ideals that are capable of 
                        restoring humanitarian values in society (Britannica, The Editors of Encyclopaedia).

                    <p>At a very young age, the main character of this story, who is also the writer, Richard Wright, was alone and on his own. Very early on in his
                        life his father left his mother to be with another woman. With only one person bringing income into the family, Richard found often found
                        himself roaming around on his own. This resulted in him getting into trouble fairly often. For a brief time, Ella, Richard's mother moves
                        the family to live with her sister Maggie, and her husband Hoskins. One day after Hoskins is murdered, and the family is threatened. Ella and 
                        Maggie decide to move to West Helena, Arkansas, where they would combine their earnings and live a comfortable life. This is short lived, as 
                        Maggie quickly finds a new man to move in with. Once she leaves, money becomes very tight and the Wright family struggles once again. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After Richard's mother has a severe stroke, she is unable to work and the family had to move in with Ella's mother in Jackson, Mississippi 
                        where here siblings decide to help take care of her and her two children. It's decided that Richard's brother , Alan will be living with Maggie,
                        while Richard gets to choose who he continue to live with. He decides to stay with his Uncle Clark who lives in Greenwood, Mississippi. Once
                        discovering that there had been a boy who had died in the bedroom that he would be staying in, Richard decides to stay with his Grandmother. He
                        quickly realizes the mistake that he has made
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Richard's grandmother was a very strict woman and was very serious about religion. This did not sit well with Richard as he had been used to a
                        much higher degree of freedom, and he had not had much exposure to religion thus far into his life. His grandmother tries to spend a lot of her time
                        "cleansing" Richard, as she believes that he is extremely sinful and disobedient. As an attempt to introduce religion into his life, his grandmother
                        forces him to attend a religious school where Richard quickly discovers that he has a hard time fitting in with the rest of the students.

                        Despite having a hard time fitting in, Richard quickly rises to the top of his class. This is where Richard first gets a taste of writing. At this point
                        of his life, he writes a short story called <em>The Voodoo of Hell's Half-Acre</em>, and has it published in a local black newspaper.  After graduating
                        Richard finds himself struggling in the working world. Richard had encountered racism in his childhood but not as aggressively as he is now. The realization
                        of the hostility of the environment he is in, Richard decides to move to the north as soon as possible. Through a series of legal and illegal sales, he 
                        finally saves up enough money to move to Memphis where he can find a paying job to fund further travel to Chicago.

                        In Memphis, richard gets a job in an optical shop where he has a coworker named Falk who allows Richard to use his library card to checkout whatever books
                        he wanted. This is where Richard first gets to really delve into his personal desires, and is able to address his strong thirst for knowledge. Later on
                        Richard's brother, his mother, and her sister join him in Memphis, and it is at this point when they all decide to move to Chicagor

                        In Chicago, Richard quickly finds a job, but this is short lived as the Great Depression leaves millions of people without jobs. This resulted in Richard
                        first coming into contact with the concept of communism. He then becomes a communist party member as the thought of fighting against oppression resonates
                        with him on a deep level. He begins to write more stories an books that revolve around the idea of revolting and breaking free of your oppressors.
