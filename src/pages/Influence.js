                        Independence as a child is a double edged sword. While you may have a lot of freedom and autonomy, an excess amount of independence can lead to a 
                        lack of direction and order in life. Having purpose in life can be the driving force in the development of one's growing personality. This is a problem
                        that a lot of young and disadvantaged blacks face. A lack of purpose often times leads to a life of mediocrity and low self-esteem. Ironically enough,
                        although Richard Wright's childhood was a recipe for this kind of life, his thirst for knowledge gave him purpose and drive. It took him to places many
                        thought were not possible for someone like him.

                    <p>
                        To this day, there are many young and disadvantaged blacks that do not have the influences in their lives to give them drive and purpose. In Wright's
                        case, his own thirst for knowledge saved him, but this is often times not the case. While the solution to this problem may seem straightforward (that
                        solution being, getting positive influences into the lives of young blacks), putting that into action is an entirely new problem. Aside from having this 
                        positive influence in their lives, these children must have a reason to admire this individual. Although this is an interesting problem to ponder on, we
                        are here to analyze the issues pointed out in Wright's writing, and see how many of these issues are still issues in current society.

                    <p>
                        An unfiltered world is a dangerous world for a child. As stated before, independence and autonomy is a double edged sword. Like most things in life, these
                        should be administered in moderation. Allowing a child to be exposed to non-child friendly content results in a number of developmental issues later in life.
                        Alongside the isses caused to the individual, assuming this individual has children of their own, these developmental issues have a fairly high chance of being 
                        passed down to their children. The same goes for their grandchildren. This creates a viscious loop of bad habits and issues. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Next to the habits being passed down, having a large concentration of it in one area creates a toxic community and society. If a community becomes too toxic, it
                        begins to get treated poorly by the rest of society. This community becomes disadvantaged, and in most cases oppressed. Just like the viscious loop of bad habits 
                        being passed down by parents, these issues are then multiplied by society.
