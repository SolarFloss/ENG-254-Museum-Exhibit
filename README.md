# ENG 254 Museum Exhibit Project

This is a project for my ENG 254 clacc (Afro-American Literature II), which we were taksed with creating a website to act as an exhibit for an African American writer, from a list of choices. I chose to base my site around Richard Wright's book *Black Boy*. 

# What it is made in

In order to take advantage of the attributes of SPA's (Single Page Applications) I used React to build the site. This way the site works offline once viewed once, and navigating to different parts of the site is extremely quick. 

Aside from the technology, the site is completely responsive. The site is currently a rough draft as the full project is not due for some time, so I still have some tweaks to do, but the site will change layout and font-sizes, based on the width of your screen. This provides an optimal viewing experience for a number of devices.
